        <h2>Etymology & Definition</h2>
        <p>
          The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, and
          its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to jasm,
          a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning 'pep, energy'.The earliest
          written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles
          Times in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which
          he called a 'jazz ball' "because it wobbles and you simply can't do
          anything with it". The use of the word in a musical context was
          documented as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune.Its first
          documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November
          14, 1916, Times-Picayune article about "jas bands". In an interview
          with National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his
          recollections of the slang connotations of the term, saying: "When
          Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called
          that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what
          it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies. "The American Dialect
          Society named it the Word of the 20th Century. Albert Gleizes, 1915,
          Composition for "Jazz" from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York
          Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of
          music spanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to
          rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the
          perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music
          history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that
          its terms of reference and its definition should be broader,defining
          jazz as a "form of art music which originated in the United States
          through the confrontation of the Negro with European music" and
          arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a
          "special relationship to time defined as 'swing'". Jazz involves "a
          spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation
          plays a role" and contains a "sonority and manner of phrasing which
          mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician". A broader
          definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed
          by Travis Jackson: "it is music that includes qualities such as swing,
          improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', and
          being open to different musical possibilities". Krin Gibbard argued
          that "jazz is a construct" which designates "a number of musics with
          enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent
          tradition".Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said,
          "It's all music."

        <h2>Elements</h2>
        
        <h3>Improvisation</h3>
        <p>
          Although jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it
          contains many subgenres, improvisation is one of its defining
          elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the
          influence of earlier forms of music such as blues, a form of folk
          music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of
          African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly
          structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early
          blues was also improvisational. Classical music performance is
          evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, with less
          attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment.
          The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was
          written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of
          interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution
          of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer.The jazz
          performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same
          composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and
          interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may
          change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.In early Dixieland,
          a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and
          improvising countermelodies. In the swing era of the 1920s and 1940s,
          big bands relied more on arrangements which were written or learned by
          ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In
          the bebop era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and
          minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the
          beginning and most of the piece was improvised. Modal jazz abandoned
          chord progressions to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many
          forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of one or
          more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The
          rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the composition
          structure and complement the soloist.In avant-garde and free jazz, the
          separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or
          even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.
        </p>
        <h3>Traditionalism</h3>
        <p>
          Since the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially
          oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized.
          According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a "tension between
          jazz as a commercial music and an art form".Regarding the Dixieland
          jazz revival of the 1940s, Black musicians rejected it as being
          shallow nostalgia entertainment for white audiences.On the other hand,
          traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz
          fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An alternative view is
          that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles.By avoiding
          the creation of norms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.

        <h2>Diversity in Jazz</h2>

        <h3>Jazz and race</h3>
        <p>
          For some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to
          African-American contributions to culture and history. For others,
          jazz is a reminder of "an oppressive and racist society and
          restrictions on their artistic visions".Amiri Baraka argues that there
          is a "white jazz" genre that expresses whiteness. White jazz musicians
          appeared in the Midwest and in other areas throughout the U.S. Papa
          Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was
          called "the father of white jazz". The Original Dixieland Jazz Band,
          whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix
          Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the
          1920s.The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians such as Eddie
          Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from
          Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of
          swing during the 1930s.Many bands included both Black and white
          musicians. These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the
          U.S.

        <h3>Roles of women</h3>
        <p>
          Female jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz
          throughout its history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald,
          Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O'Day,
          Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters were recognized for their vocal
          talent, less familiar were bandleaders, composers, and
          instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, trumpeter
          Valaida Snow, and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields.
          Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early 1920s, drawing
          particular recognition on piano.[32] When male jazz musicians were
          drafted during World War II, many all-female bands replaced them.[32]
          The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, which was founded in 1937,
          was a popular band that became the first all-female integrated band in
          the U.S. and the first to travel with the USO, touring Europe in 1945.
          Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson.
          Beginning in the 1950s, many women jazz instrumentalists were
          prominent, some sustaining long careers. Some of the most distinctive
          improvisers, composers, and bandleaders in jazz have been women.[33]
          Trombonist Melba Liston is acknowledged as the first female horn
          player to work in major bands and to make a real impact on jazz, not
          only as a musician but also as a respected composer and arranger,
          particularly through her collaborations with Randy Weston from the
          late 1950s into the 1990s.

        <h3>Jews in Jazz</h3>
        <p>
          Jewish Americans played a significant role in jazz. As jazz spread, it
          developed to encompass many different cultures, and the work of Jewish
          composers in Tin Pan Alley helped shape the many different sounds that
          jazz came to incorporate.Jewish Americans were able to thrive in Jazz
          because of the probationary whiteness that they were allotted at the
          time.George Bornstein wrote that African Americans were sympathetic to
          the plight of the Jewish American and vice versa. As disenfranchised
          minorities themselves, Jewish composers of popular music saw
          themselves as natural allies with African Americans.[38] The Jazz
          Singer with Al Jolson is one example of how Jewish Americans were able
          to bring jazz, music that African Americans developed, into popular
          culture.Benny Goodman was a vital Jewish American to the progression
          of Jazz. Goodman was the leader of a racially integrated band named
          King of Swing. His jazz concert in the Carnegie Hall in 1938 was the
          first ever to be played there. The concert was described by Bruce Eder
          as "the single most important jazz or popular music concert in
          history".Shep Fields also helped to popularize "Sweet" Jazz music
          through his appearances and Big band remote broadcasts from such
          landmark venues as Chicago's Palmer House, Broadway's Paramount
          Theater and the Starlight Roof at the famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He
          entertained audiences with a light elegant musical style which
          remained popular with audiences for nearly three decades from the
          1930s until the late 1950s.

        <h2>The Jazz Age</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          From 1920 to 1933, Prohibition in the United States banned the sale of
          alcoholic drinks, resulting in illicit speakeasies which became lively
          venues of the "Jazz Age", hosting popular music, dance songs, novelty
          songs, and show tunes. Jazz began to get a reputation as immoral, and
          many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old
          cultural values by promoting the decadent values of the Roaring 20s.
          Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote, "... it is not music at
          all. It's merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual
          teasing of the strings of physical passion."[117] The New York Times
          reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears, but
          the villagers had used pots and pans; another story claimed that the
          fatal heart attack of a celebrated conductor was caused by jazz.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Swing in the 20s and 30s</h3>
        <p>
          The 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some virtuoso
          soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in
          developing the "big" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers
          Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington,
          Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry James, Jimmie
          Lunceford, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw. Although it was a collective
          sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to "solo" and
          improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex
          "important" music. Over time, social strictures regarding racial
          segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to
          recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the
          mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson, vibraphonist
          Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join small groups.
          In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist
          Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop
          influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as "jumping the
          blues" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord
          progressions, drawing on boogie-woogie from the 1930s.
        </p>
        <h3>The influence of Duke Ellington</h3>
        <p>
          While swing was reaching the height of its popularity, Duke Ellington
          spent the late 1920s and 1930s developing an innovative musical idiom
          for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he
          experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and musical form with
          complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences;
          some of his tunes became hits, and his own popularity spanned from the
          United States to Europe. Ellington called his music American Music,
          rather than jazz, and liked to describe those who impressed him as
          "beyond category".These included many musicians from his orchestra,
          some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right,
          but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most popular jazz
          orchestras in the history of jazz. He often composed for the style and
          skills of these individuals, such as "Jeep's Blues" for Johnny Hodges,
          "Concerto for Cootie" for Cootie Williams (which later became "Do
          Nothing Till You Hear from Me" with Bob Russell's lyrics), and "The
          Mooche" for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also recorded
          compositions written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's "Caravan"
          and "Perdido", which brought the "Spanish Tinge" to big-band jazz.
          Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several
          decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when
          Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers
          wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous
          creativity.
        </p>
        <h3>Beginnings of European Jazz</h3>
        <p>
          As only a limited number of American jazz records were released in
          Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists
          such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and Lonnie Johnson, who
          visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live
          performances which inspired European audiences' interest in jazz, as
          well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic)
          which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during
          this time.The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to
          emerge in this interwar period. British jazz began with a tour by the
          Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. In 1926, Fred Elizalde and His
          Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter
          jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras, and
          jazz instrumentalists became numerous.This style entered full swing in
          France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which began in 1934.
          Much of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz
          and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well-trained;
          in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman
          since his style was also a fusion of the two.Belgian guitarist Django
          Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz, a mix of 1930s American swing,
          French dance hall "musette", and Eastern European folk with a languid,
          seductive feel; the main instruments were steel stringed guitar,
          violin, and double bass. Solos pass from one player to another as
          guitar and bass form the rhythm section. Some researchers believe
          Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti pioneered the guitar-violin partnership
          characteristic of the genre,which was brought to France after they had
          been heard live or on Okeh Records in the late 1920s.
